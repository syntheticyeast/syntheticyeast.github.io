      <description>Franchising Build a Genome The Build-A-Genome course has been franchised at multiple institutions. In the United States, B-A-G is taught at Loyola University (Baltimore, MD) and Hartwick College, and courses are being planned at North Carolina State University. In China, Tianjin University has used the B-A-G China course to build synthetic DNA corresponding to chromosomes syn5 and syn10.
If you are interested in leading a B-A-G course, the BAG Network can provide information.</description>

      <description>Course Description The Build-A-Genome (B-A-G) Course was introduced in 2007, and is now offered for up to 20 students each semester and during the summer. To date, about 200 students have completed the course, including students majoring in computer science, biomedical engineering, biology, chemical and bio-molecular engineering, and biophysics. Entering students are interviewed to evaluate their understanding of the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), DNA cloning and sequencing, nucleic acid structure, biopolymer synthesis, and more before acceptance.</description>
