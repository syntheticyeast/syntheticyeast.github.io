      <description>We will introduce rather conservative changes to the genome sequence, initially deleting or relocating genomic features using strategies we feel, from first principles, are unlikely to reduce fitness significantly. At the same time, we will be introducing site-specific recombination sequences, allowing subsequent in vitro evolution of the yeast strains generated. This opens up a whole new dimension – not just one synthetic genome, but whole populations of synthetic genomes will be available for analysis and future study.</description>

      <description>A number of guidelines have been proposed in response to the ethics issues, including safety, raised by synthetic biology. Our published commentary describes the balance between freedom and responsibility in synthetic genomics: Sliva et al 2015 Genetics.
Currently, the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules serves as the main document guiding NIH-funded synthetic biology research. These guidelines focus on DNA synthesis companies as the primary point of intervention; other guidelines focus on the researchers themselves.</description>

      <description>A variety of mentorship and training experiences, both virtual and physical, have taken place with SAVI support.
The Boeke group, now located at NYU (synI, synIII, synIV, synVI, synVIII, synIX), has developed an ‘Sc2.0 Starter Package’ for distribution to all groups building synthetic chromosomes. This document details protocols relevant to the incorporation of synthetic DNA into yeast cells starting from ~10kb, specifically focusing on the workflow to integrate the first three megachunks of synVI.</description>

      <description>Chemists first probing the structure of matter used analytical approaches, describing what they perceived. They subsequently gained a far more thorough mastery of and insights into chemical compounds by synthesizing them. Biology is now undergoing a similar transition from the age of deciphering DNA sequence information of the genomes of biological species to a synthetic genome age; and this transition demands a whole new level of biological understanding, which we currently lack.</description>

      <description>With support from SAVI, we host an annual Synthetic Yeast Genome Meeting. These meetings provide critical ‘face time’ for all researchers involved in the project to directly interact, in particular the students and postdocs who are the frontline ‘chromosome builders’. Additionally, these meeting attract members from the synthetic biology community, yeast research community, plus representatives from industry. The yearly meeting provides an important opportunity to discuss downstream uses of the synthetic genome and collaborations with groups wishing to get involved in using Sc2.</description>

      <description>The strategy to build the Sc2.0 genome is based on a hierarchical assembly plan devised specifically for this project. Building blocks (~750bp) are assembled into minichunks (~3kb), which are assembled into into chunks (~10kb), which are subsequently assembled into megachunks (30-50kb) that can finally be introduced into yeast to replace the corresponding wild type sequence.
Here we will describe the design and workflow associated with assembling chunks into megachunks and yeast transformation.</description>

      <description>We use haploid strains allowing simple growth (fitness) tests to be performed after each cycle of incorporating a synthetic segment. A straightforward and relatively sensitive way for us to monitor fitness on an ongoing basis is to examine colony size when the strain is plated out on the appropriate selective and non-selective media and compared to the parental strain(s). However, while this method will readily identify instances in which alterations lead to relatively major fitness defects, minor fitness defects may not be detected and certainly the spectrum of growth conditions examined will be small.</description>

      <description>Planned alterations to native chromosome sequence are potentially infinite in number and so a great deal of thought must be given to the specific alterations to be incorporated into the synthetic chromosome(s). In general, we are making modest changes predicted to have minimal or no impact on fitness of the organism under laboratory conditions.
The synthetic DNA encoding the designer changes are introduced in a stepwise, “bottom up” approach. The advantage here is that the “investment” made in the project at any given stage is limited to 30-60kb, so if a particular segment is incompatible with viability, or gives rise to a slow-growth phenotype, the segment can be re-synthesized after the nature of the growth defect is mapped and diagnosed (by singly transforming in the 10kb pieces, or by mapping which segments of a given 30-60 kb “megachunk” are incorporated during transformation [PCRTags].</description>

      <description>The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been in use by humans since at least the ancient Sumerians and is consumed daily, in various forms, by billions of people. As such, the organism is Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) by the United States Food and Drug Association (FDA). Our experiments utilize strains of the BY lineage, directly derived from the S288C strain, which has been undergoing laboratory propagation since its isolation from a rotting fig in Merced, California, in 1938.</description>

      <description>The global Sc2.0 team has built five new synthetic yeast chromosomes, meaning that 30 percent of S.cerevisiae’s genetic material has now been swapped out for engineered replacements. This is one of several findings of a package of seven papers published March 10 as the cover story for Science.
An international team of more than 200 authors produced the latest work from the Synthetic Yeast Project (Sc2.0). By the end of this year, this international consortium hopes to have designed and built synthetic versions all 16 chromosomes – the structures that contain DNA – for S.</description>

      <description>The best explanation may be an apocryphal quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin: &amp;ldquo;Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy&amp;rdquo;. S. cerevisiae is the organism of choice for these studies because the genomic and related resources that are available are, quite simply, better than for any other organism on the planet. There are eukaryotes with smaller genomes, to be sure, but the extent of knowledge about these species pales by comparison to S.</description>
